Hello Evaluator,

My name is Ravita Prajapati, and I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed my assessment for the Backend Developer role.

For data transactions, I have utilized a MySQL database. Enclosed with this submission, you will find a SQL file containing a backup of the database. Please import this database into MySQL Workbench on your system to thoroughly test each API.

Additionally, you can review more of my development work on my GitHub account: https://github.com/RavitaP12345.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
